-----------------------------
Prerequisites:
-----------------------------
For the pre-built example FPGA image, you just need Vivado.
To build the custom image, you need Vivado and the SiFive RISC-V toolchain installed.


-----------------------------
Documentation:
-----------------------------

  Arty A7 comes in two FPGA variants: Arty A7-35T features Xilinx XC7A35TICSG324-1L. Arty A7-100T features the larger Xilinx XC7A100TCSG324-1


-----------------------------
Loading the pre-built example RISCV FPGA Image (blink):
-----------------------------

  Plug Arty board into USB cable.
  Make sure the Virtual Machine has control of the device "Digilent USB Device" and USB device is connected (instructions above)
  (If you unplug the Arty and plug it back in you may need to re-enable VM control of the USB device)
  
  Run Vivado -> Flow -> Open Hardware Manager -> Open Target -> AutoConnect - should see Xilinx_tcf/Digilent/<ID Number>    
  Right-click on xc7a35t_0, select ”Add Configuration Memory Device”
  Seach for "mt25ql128" - will show image with alias n25q128-3.3v-*
  Press "Yes" when it asks if you want to program the Configuration Memory Device
  Select freedom-e310-arty-1-0-2.mcs  (Instructions to download:   SiFive Freedom E310 Arty FPGA Dev Kit Getting Started Guide - Chapter 3)
  Leave defaults - hit okay to begin programming
  You should see the red and green LEDs on the USB side of the board light up.
  (Don't switch away from VM focus during this or it may error out)
  You should see a "programming successful" message.
  After resetting the board (re-plugging the cable may be required) you should see the LED blink program running.

Loading the custom-compiled RISCV FPGA Image (blink):
-----------------------------

  Plug Arty board into USB cable.
  Make sure the Virtual Machine has control of the device "Digilent USB Device" and USB device is connected (instructions above)
  (If you unplug the Arty and plug it back in you may need to re-enable VM control of the USB device)

  Seach for "mt25ql128" - will show image with alias n25q128-3.3v-*
  Press "Yes" when it asks if you want to program the Configuration Memory Device
  Select the compiled binary (in my repo it's E300ArtyDevKitFPGAChip.mcs)
  If available, select the compiled .prm file (in my repo it's E300ArtyDevKitFPGAChip.prm)
  Leave defaults - hit okay to begin programming
  You should see the red and green LEDs on the USB side of the board light up.
  (Don't switch away from VM focus during this or it may error out)
