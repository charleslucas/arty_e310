# arty_e310

-----------------------------
Prerequisites:
-----------------------------
Program the Arty e310 with either the pre-build FPGA image or the custom-built image - see FPGA_Programming.txt


  
-----------------------------
Connecting to the Arty (through the USB port) via terminal program (Using Virtual Machine w' Linux, may work w' Linux Subsystem):
-----------------------------
On the VM:
  
  sudo apt install screen (first time setup)
  
  sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB2 115200
  (115200 for the precompiled image - 57600 for the compiled freedom image - https://forums.sifive.com/t/printing-over-uart-broken/1322) 
  
  Press Reset on the Arty
  You should see text like that shown in the Getting Started Guide

Issue - currently the output text is flaky (using both images), and varies from reset to reset.  Have seen similar complaints in forum.  Could be a an actual protocol issue, or perhaps an issue in translation between host and VM control.



-----------------------------
Running the software debugger with Blink (via the Olimex):
-----------------------------
  In case you have to install the FTDI drivers, but in Ubuntu they should be included in the kernel by default:  https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_220_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf
  
  Make sure the Virtual Machine has control of the device "Olimex Ltd. OpenOCD JTAG ARM-USB-TINY-H"  (Not "Olimex Ltd. ARM-USB-TINY-H JTAG interface").  If it's not there, then ensure the VM is started *before* the Olimex is connected to the host and try again.
  
  Connect the Olimex to the Arty board according to the diagram and picture on pages 4/5 of the Getting Started Guide
  Connect the Olimex to a USB cable, and connect to the host machine.
  Once you plug the Olimex into the host *and* into the Arty, program execution will halt.
