-----------------------------
To create an FPGA image containing the RISC-V processor:
-----------------------------

The best way I have found to do this is to compile Chisel->RTL and synthesize the FPGA image under Windows 10 Linux Subsystem,
although I did also successfully create the FPGA image on a virtual machine running Ubuntu.
Once the image is createds, use Vivado under bare Windows 10 to program the FPGA image onto the Arty.

The sections below detail the steps for each OS option.  FPGA image creation on bare Windows 10 has not completed successfully.



-----------------------------
Creating the RTL (from Chisel source) and building the FPGA Image File (Configuration Memory File) from source under Windows Linux Subsystem w' Ubuntu:
-----------------------------

 Build the RTL and MCS (make sure you do these in order):
  The Makefile corresponding to the Freedom E300 Arty FPGA Dev Kit is Makefile.e300artydevkit and it consists of two main targets:

  #verilog: to compile the Chisel source files and generate the Verilog files.  (You must have the RISC-V toolchain installed to do this)
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog
  
  #mcs: to create a Configuration Memory File (.mcs) that can be programmed onto an Arty FPGA board.  (You must have the RISC-V toolchain installed to do this)
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit mcs
  
  (output files under builds/e300artydevkit/obj)


-----------------------------
To create an FPGA image containing the RISC-V processor (Using Windows 10 Linux Subsystem):
-----------------------------

To enable the Linux Subsystem in Powershell:
  https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-linux-subsystem-for-windows10/
    Search for “PowerShell” in the Start Menu.
    Right click on the PowerShell icon and choose “Run as Administrator.”
    Copy the following command and paste it to the PowerShell command line:
      Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
    Press Y, then Enter to restart your computer when prompted. Your PC will restart instantly, so be sure to save any work beforehand.
    
Install your Linux distro from the Microsoft Store - I chose Ubuntu

Get a Linux Subsystem Window:
  Start cmd window
  Run 'ubuntu' and login

Clone SiFive Freedom E310 github repository:
  git clone http://github.com/sifive/freedom
  cd freedom
  #Run this command to update sub-repositories used by freedom
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  
###Download the precompiled GNU Embedded Toolchain and OpenOCD for Ubuntu:  https://www.sifive.com/boards (near the bottom)
Install prebuilt RISC-V Toolchain
  Download GNU Embedded Toolchain and OpenOCD from: https://www.sifive.com/boards
  (Check for more recent version of below tools)

  /opt/Digilent/
  wget -c https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.05.3-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  wget -c https://static.dev.sifive.com/dev-tools/riscv-openocd-0.10.0-2019.05.1-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  
  /opt/Digilent/
  sudo tar xvfz riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.05.3-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  sudo tar xvfz riscv-openocd-0.10.0-2019.05.1-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14.tar.gz
  
  Add the following line to ~/.bashrc:
    export RISCV=/opt/Digilent/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.05.3-x86_64-linux-ubuntu14/

  source ~/.bashrc


### (Alternate method - not tested) To install the RISCV tools that synthesize the verilog source code into an FPGA image:
  Install the RISC-V Toolchain:
    sudo apt install nodejs
    sudo apt install npm
    sudo npm install --global xpm
    sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
    xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
    Make sure Vivado is installed and on the path:
      Add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:
        export RISCV=~/opt/xPacks/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/8.2.0-2.2.1/.content
      source ~/.bashrc
      
To compile the chisel source code into Verilog source code:
  cd ~/freedom
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog

To create the Configuration Memory File (.mcs) that can be programmed onto an Arty FPGA board.  (You must have the RISC-V toolchain installed to do this)
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit mcs
 
If you are loading the image using Vivado under bare Windows, copy your compiled image from the Linux Subsystem world to the bare Windows world before loading.
It is not recommended to edit files under Linux Subsystem directly using tools under bare Windows:

-----------------------------
To create an FPGA image containing the RISC-V processor (Using a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu and Linux Toolflow):
-----------------------------

Install Ubuntu on a virtual machine.
  Only a minimal OS install is necessary, but give yourself at least 120G HD and 3GB of RAM.
  If you have only 2GB of RAM the "make <board> mcs" step will fail with this message:  /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.2/bin/loader: line 194: 11809 Killed $RDI_PROG

Install git, make, java, gcc, dtc, python:
  sudo apt install git
  sudo apt install make
  sudo apt install default-jdk
  sudo apt install gcc
  sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
  sudo apt install python
  
Download and install latest version of Vivado HL Design Edition (12.5G Download!):
  https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html
  http://xilinx.com/getlicense
  
Make sure to install the proper board files in Vivado:
  https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/software/vivado/board-files

Install the drivers to talk to the Arty board over USB/FTDI.
  Instructions in the Arty Getting Started Guide - seach for "drivers"
  (Instructions say that ttyUSB* should be under the plugdev group, but on my VM they were under the dialout group instead, so I added myself to that group)
  
  Instructions how to install Xilinx cable drivers:
  https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/59128.html
  cd /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.2/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers
  
  Connect USB Device:
    In Virtual Machine, connect Host Machine's USB Device "Digilent USB Device" to the virtual machine.

   To verify USB Device is connected (Host Machine):
     Download the Windows version of the "Agent2" utility, and see if it will connect to the XC7A35T FPGA
     (If not, some debug forum discussion here:
       https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/4877-cannot-talk-to-arty-board-with-vivado-172/
       https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/8977-vivado-not-finding-arty-target/
     )

   To verify USB Device is connected (Virtual Machine):
    Run 'lsusb', should see a device "Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT2232C Dual USB-UART/FIFO IC"
    Run 'ls -al /dev/ttyUSB1' (If you have multiple USB devices, may be ttyUSB3,5,7, etc.  Maybe have to detach USB device and see which one disappears.
    Run Vivado (<prompt>/vivado) -> Flow -> Open Hardware Manager -> Open Target -> AutoConnect - should see Xilinx_tcf/Digilent/<ID Number>    
    
On Virtual Machine - Install SiFive RISC-V Toolchain w' OpenOCD

-----------------------------
To create an FPGA image containing the RISC-V processor  (Using bare Windows 10):
-----------------------------

Install the RISCV ToolChain (for Windows):
  https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/riscv/install/
  Install node.js:
    https://nodejs.org/en/  (Currently 10.16.0 LTS)
  Install the xpack utility:
    https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/windows-build-tools/install/
  Install Git for Windows:
    https://git-scm.com/download/win  (for some reason I could only download with MS Edge, not Chrome)
    Make sure you can run git through a new Windows command-line window.

Go to "GitHub Releases":  https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/releases
Download the latest windows binary:  gnu-mcu-eclipse-riscv-none-gcc-<latest>-win64.zip
Open zip file, copy "GNU MCU Eclipse" folder into %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\
Restart Eclipse

Install the build tools - make and BusyBox (sh/rm/echo):
  https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/windows-build-tools/
  https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/windows-build-tools/install/
  Note:  Using these tools necessitates unix-style paths and makefiles
  Go to "ARM MCU Eclipse Windows Build Tools":  https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/releases
  Download the latest windows binary:  gnu-mcu-eclipse-windows-build-tools-<version>-win64.zip
  (In my case Github gave me a 404 error, so I had to use the xpack option - open up a cmd window, make sure xpm works, and run 'xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools')


Note - they recommend not adding the build tools to the system path, so when you go to compile freedom (see Vivado_Setup.txt), you will need to use the whole bin path like:
  C:\Users\"Charley Lucas"\AppData\Roaming\xPacks\@gnu-mcu-eclipse\windows-build-tools\2.12.1-1\.content\bin\make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog
or in git bash:
  /c/Users/Charley\ Lucas/AppData/Roaming/xPacks/\@gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/2.12.1-1/.content/bin/make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog

My build failed with an frrtl error, I found a description of it here with some suggestions:  https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl/issues/910

I made a fresh clone of just frrtl and compiled it to duplicate the issue.
To do a manual compile I downloaded the latest sbt (Scala Build Tool) utility for Windows:  https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
The sbt build needs javac, so I installed a Java JDK (I picked version 8) - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

My attempt to manually compile firrtl using sbt under bare Windows:
  Download and install the latest sbt (Scala Build Tool) utility for Windows:  https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
  The sbt build needs javac, so I install the Java JDK (I picked version 8) - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  cd freedom/rocket-chip/firrtl
  sbt assembly

My attempt to manually compile firrtl using sbt under Linux subsystem:
  install Ubuntu linux subsystem and set up with account
  sudo apt install make
  Download and unzip the latest version of sbt:  https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
  Install Oracle java jdk 8 - https://www.codingepiphany.com/2017/06/12/installing-java-windows-linux-subsystem/
  cd freedom/rocket-chip/firrtl
  ~/sbt/bin/sbt assembly
This should result in a successful message.  Now copy the firrtl compiled with linux subsystem over in place of the one compiled under Windows:
Rename the Windows firrtl to firrtl.orig
Copy 
C:\Users\Charley Lucas\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\cdlucas\freedom\rocket-chip\firrtl in it's place.
(Ignore the file-too-long errors)

To compile the chisel source code into Verilog source code:
  cd ~/freedom
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog
  Build will fail the first time
  cd freedom/rocket-chip/firrtl
  ~/sbt/bin/sbt publishLocal
  /c/Users/Charley\ Lucas/AppData/Roaming/xPacks/\@gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/2.12.1-1/.content/bin/make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit verilog

To synthesize the verilog source code into an FPGA image: 
  sudo apt install nodejs
  sudo apt install npm
  xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
  export RISCV=~/opt/xPacks/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/8.2.0-2.2.1/.content
  sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
  -Make sure Vivado is installed and on the path-
  make -f Makefile.e300artydevkit mcs
