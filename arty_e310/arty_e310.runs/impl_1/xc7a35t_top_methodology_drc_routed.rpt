LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell led3_b_OBUF_inst_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) btn0_edge_detect/pulse_reg/CLR, btn0_edge_detect/signal_ff_reg/CLR, btn1_edge_detect/pulse_reg/CLR, btn1_edge_detect/signal_ff_reg/CLR, fifo0_ack_edge_convert/signal_ff_reg/CLR, fifo0_ack_edge_detect/pulse_reg/CLR, fifo0_ack_edge_detect/signal_ff_reg/CLR, fifo_0/ack_reg/CLR, fifo_0/pop_ptr_reg[0]/CLR, fifo_0/pop_ptr_reg[1]/CLR, fifo_0/pop_ptr_reg[2]/CLR, fifo_0/pop_ptr_reg[3]/CLR, fifo_0/pop_ptr_reg[4]/CLR, fifo_0/push_ptr_reg[0]/CLR, fifo_0/push_ptr_reg[1]/CLR (the first 15 of 36 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.759 ns between fifo0_ack_edge_convert/signal_ff_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3) and fifo0_ack_edge_detect/signal_ff_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.852 ns between lfsr0_output_valid_sff_gen/signal1_ff_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1) and lfsr0_output_valid_dff_gen/signal1_ff_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.010 ns between fifo0_ack_edge_convert/signal_ff_reg/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3) and fifo0_ack_edge_detect/pulse_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.137 ns between galois_lfsr_0/lfsr_out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1) and fifo_0/fifo_data_reg_0_15_0_3/RAMA_D1/I (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.185 ns between galois_lfsr_0/lfsr_out_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1) and fifo_0/fifo_data_reg_0_15_0_3/RAMB_D1/I (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.211 ns between galois_lfsr_0/lfsr_out_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1) and fifo_0/fifo_data_reg_0_15_0_3/RAMB/I (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.287 ns between galois_lfsr_0/lfsr_out_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_1) and fifo_0/fifo_data_reg_0_15_0_3/RAMA/I (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_3). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
